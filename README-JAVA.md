- **Yellow Buttons**: Advanced operations requiring caution (WinSxS, Hibernation)
- **Red Button**: Permanent deletion operations (Recycle Bin)

### Output Panel
- Real-time command output
- Scrollable log area
- Automatic scroll to latest output
- Color-coded status messages

## Requirements

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher**
- **Windows Operating System** (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- **Administrator privileges** required for proper functionality

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command Prompt or PowerShell

### Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6a6ak/SafeClean_WinX_PS1.git
   cd SafeClean_WinX_PS1
   ```

2. **Run the build script**:
   ```cmd
   build.bat
   ```

3. **The built JAR will be in the `dist` folder**:
   ```
   dist/SafeCleanGUI.jar
   ```

### Manual Build
If you prefer to build manually:

```cmd
# Compile
javac -d build SafeCleanGUI.java

# Create JAR
cd build
jar cfe ../dist/SafeCleanGUI.jar SafeCleanGUI *.class
```

## Running the Application

### From JAR File
```cmd
java -jar dist/SafeCleanGUI.jar
```

### Running as Administrator
**Important**: Right-click on Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator", then run the JAR file.

## Creating an Executable (.exe)

You can convert the JAR to a Windows executable using several tools:

### Option 1: Launch4j (Recommended)
1. Download Launch4j from http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/
2. Create a configuration file pointing to your JAR
3. Generate the .exe file
4. The exe will automatically require admin privileges

### Option 2: jpackage (Java 14+)
```cmd
jpackage --input dist --name SafeCleanGUI --main-jar SafeCleanGUI.jar --main-class SafeCleanGUI --type exe --win-console
```

### Option 3: GraalVM Native Image
For a truly native executable with faster startup times.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Java is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
- Install Java JDK/JRE and ensure it's in your system PATH

**Operations fail silently**
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Check Windows permissions for the target directories

**GUI doesn't start**
- Verify Java version with `java -version`
- Check if any antivirus is blocking the application

**PowerShell execution errors**
- The application automatically sets execution policy bypass
- Ensure PowerShell is available on the system
