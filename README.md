## What Each Option Does

### 1. Clean Temporary Files
- Clears `%TEMP%` (user temporary files)
- Clears `C:\Windows\Temp` (system temporary files)

### 2. Clean Windows Update Cache
- Stops Windows Update service
- Clears `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download`
- Restarts Windows Update service

### 3. Clean Thumbnail Cache
- Removes thumbnail cache from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer`

### 4. Clear Event Logs
- Clears all Windows Event Logs
- Provides feedback on which logs were cleared or skipped

### 5. Reduce WinSxS Folder (Advanced)
- Uses DISM to clean up Windows Component Store
- Runs `StartComponentCleanup` with `ResetBase` option
- **Warning**: This is an advanced operation

### 6. Disable Hibernation & Remove hiberfil.sys
- Disables Windows hibernation feature
- Removes the hibernation file (hiberfil.sys) which can be several GB in size
- Frees up space equal to your system's RAM size
- **Note**: Can be re-enabled later with `powercfg /hibernate on`

### 7. Clean Recycle Bin
- Completely empties the Recycle Bin
- Removes all items permanently

## Safety Features

- **Error handling**: Operations continue even if individual items can't be deleted
- **Path validation**: Checks if paths exist before attempting cleanup
- **Service management**: Properly stops and starts services when needed
- **Informative output**: Shows what's being cleaned and completion status

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Administrator Rights Required**: This script must be run as Administrator to access system folders and services.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Loss Warning**: Some operations (especially Recycle Bin and Event Logs) will permanently delete data. Use with caution.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WinSxS Cleanup**: Option 5 is an advanced operation that modifies the Windows Component Store. Only use if you understand the implications.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Hibernation Disable**: Option 6 will disable hibernation permanently and remove hiberfil.sys. This affects fast startup and hibernate features. Can be re-enabled later if needed.
